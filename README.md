This is a demonstration of how to make a backend app that handles route requests to a SQL database

## Description


## Installation
This project requires the following packages to function:
1) "dotenv" which can be found at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
2) "sequelize" which can be found at [https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/)

4) "mysql2" which can be found at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

The user must also have a .env file with their SQL credentials stored for the program to interact with the SQL database.

## Contributing
This project was built on starter code obtained from [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella). I added code to the routes files to handle database requests. I added code to the model files to provide the proper attributes and associations for the SQL tables to be linked properly. 

## Tests
No tests were prepared for this project. Error codes will be displayed by SQL if they occur and erratic behavior can be observed since the output is printed to console.
